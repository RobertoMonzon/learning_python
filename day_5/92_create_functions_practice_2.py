# Declare a function called welcome, which takes a person's name as an argument, and prints "Welcome {person_name}!"

# Create the variable person_name, and store within it the name of your choice.

# You just have to define the function and create the variable, you don't have to call the function afterwards.

def welcome(person_name):
